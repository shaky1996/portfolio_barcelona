                                    Hans Gamper (Winterthur, Switzerland,1877 – Barcelona, 1930) arrived in Barcelona in 1898 for professional reasons.During his free time, he played football with a group of friends in Bonanova.<br /><br />

                                    On 29 November, Gamper and eleven other men (Otto Kunzle and Walter Wild from Switzerland; John and William Parsons from England; Otto Maier from Germany; and Lluís d’Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol and Josep Llobet from Catalonia) came together at the Solé Gymnasium to form an association that would bear the city’s name and coat of arms: Futbol Club Barcelona.

                                    The toughest moments experienced by FC Barcelona football club were the initial post-war years. The Club reached a point where it almost ceased to exist. Subject to relentless repression and reprisals by the authorities, the identity of the organisation was changed completely.<br /><br />

                                    The purges also affected the players; anyone who had gone on the tour to Mexico and the United States was suspended for two years. Many of the players were exiled abroad. The Club’s coat of arms and name were changed because they were not deemed to be sufficiently Spanish, and the Club’s presidents were scrupulously selected by the sports authorities until 1946.

                                    To put an end once and for all to the Club’s ill fate, a star player was needed to arouse interest amongst fans. The chosen one was Johan Cruyff, the Dutch forward who had triumphed throughout Europe with AFC Ajax of Amsterdam: Cruyff, at that time was considered the best player in the world. On 13 August 1973, Cruyff joined Barça. He became the leader of a talented team, managed by Rinus Michels, which brought the Camp Nou back to its former glory. Cruyff demonstrated an intelligent style of play and superb technique.<br /><br />

                                    The Dutch star went down in history for some unforgettable moments, like his memorable goal against Atlético Madrid on 22 December 1973. Cruyff flew into the air to intercept the ball from Rexach and beat the goalkeeper, Reina.

                                    This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing string of major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the history of European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played memorable matches and won just about every title on offer. But the finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May, 2011, when the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of.<br /><br />
                                    
                                    The world's press bestowed praise on this extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible chapters in the history of the game. The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under Tito Vilanova (the league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and the Copa del Rey in another historic treble winning season.
